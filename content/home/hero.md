## My name is **Rashid Baset** and I'm a **Customer Service** professional specializing in solving customer problems. 


I am a **Customer Success Advocate** with strengths in communicating technical concepts to expert and lay audiences and quantifying and communicating uncertainty.

I am also a **Customer Service Technician** with considerable experience learning systems, technologies, and processes, which translates beautifully to solving problems, communicating effectively and even writing code.

**R-Curious** is a blog I made that explores R language using machine learning to learn and analyze customer complaints without prior industry knowledge.
