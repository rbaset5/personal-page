As a Customer Service and Data Science professional with strengths in  data cleaning, modeling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) I enjoy quantifying and communicating uncertainty using skills accrued in data acquisition, statistical analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and NLP. I am an analyst with a background in customer service, developing solutions through solid team building and project management. 

I have logged more than 3,000 hours as an experienced, early-mid career level, customer service specialist solving problems with customers delivering empathy, kindness, respect and product knowledge with considerable experience learning systems, technologies, and processes, which translates beautifully to customer success or writing code and solving challenging problems collaboratively, and is driven by contributing to the bottom line for more satisfied customers and end users.

My research interests are in customer centricity, solving customer problems and data science.
